# hi, i'm keya 🌙  
*crafting stories through code and canvas.*

sometimes it’s an app.  
sometimes it’s a feeling.

---

## fragments of me 🕸️
- designing spaces that carry stories (figma, ui/ux)
- weaving spaces with next.js, react, and node
- telling stories through code and python
- teaching and mentoring, where curiosity blooms

---

i believe design isn't how it looks -  
it's how it *listens back.*
